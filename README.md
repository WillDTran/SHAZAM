My cool &amp; awesome projects. 

Why is version / source control important?
Version control is a system that records changes to a set of file or set of files over time so that you can recall the specific versions later. It is very important since you are able to access every version of an object and revert files back to a previous state. This is very helpful when users screw up or lose a file.  Source control is very important for collaborating with developers. Without source control, changing one part of an application may cascade in a unexpected matter. Source control is required for large organizations since is is management of changes to documents, computer program, and other collection of information.


Well done!
